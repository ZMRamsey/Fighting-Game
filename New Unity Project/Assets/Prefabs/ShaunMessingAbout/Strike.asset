  _optionDescription: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a
    bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body
    off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what
    humans think is impossible. gregory, do you see the small vent on the floor?
    have you ever heard of among us, gregory? you need to vent. i know it will be
    hard for you to be sus but i know you can do it gregory.
